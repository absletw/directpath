To begin, I will survey the underlying structure of the Satipaììhãna Sutta and consider some general aspects of the four satipaììhãnas. I will then examine the expressions “direct path” and “satipaììhãna”. 
## i.1 OVERVIEW OF THE SATIPAÌÌHÃNA SUTTA 
Satipaììhãna as the “direct path” to Nibbãna has received a detailed treatment in the Satipaììhãna Sutta of the Majjhima Nikãya.[^1] Precisely the same discourse recurs as the Mahãsatipaììhãna Sutta of the Dîgha Nikãya, the only difference being that this version offers a more ex- tensive treatment of the four noble truths, the last of the satipaììhãna contemplations.[^2] The topic of satipaììhãna has moreover inspired several shorter discourses in the Saÿyutta Nikãya and the Aúguttara Nikãya.[^3] Apart from the Pãli sources, expositions on satipaììhãna are also preserved in Chinese and Sanskrit, with intriguing occasional variations from the Pãli presentations.[^4] ^1a

[^1]: M I 55–63, the tenth discourse of the Majjhima Nikãya.

[^2]: D II 305–15. The Burmese edition (sixth Saúgãyana) has added the longer section on the four noble truths to the Majjhima version as well; the Sinhalese edition, however, agrees with the pts edition in presenting only a short statement of the four noble truths.

[^3]: These are the Satipaììhãna Saÿyutta at S V 141–92, and the Satipaììhãna Vagga at A IV 457–62. In addition, there is also a Sati Vagga at A IV 336–47; a Satipaììhãna Vibhaúga at Vibh 193–207; and twice a Satipaììhãna Kathã at Kv 155–9 and at Paìis II 232–5. Shorter discourses with similar titles are the three Satipaììhãna Suttas at S IV 360, S IV 363, and A III 142; the three Sati Suttas at S II 132, S IV 245, and A IV 336; and the three Sato Suttas at S V 142, S V 180, and S V 186. 

[^4]: According to Schmithausen 1976: p.244, five additional versions are in existence: two complete versions in Chinese (in the Madhyama Ãgama: Taishõ 1, no.26, p.582b, and in the Ekottara Ãgama: Taishõ 2, no.125, p.568a), and three fragmentary versions in Chinese and Sanskrit (these being the Pañcaviÿšatisãhasrikã Prajñãpãramitã, the Šãri- putrãbhidharma (Taishõ 28, no.1548, p.525a), and the Šrãvakabhûmi). An abridged trans- lation of one of the complete Chinese versions, the Nien-ch’u-ching, being the ninety- eighth sûtra in the Chinese Madhyama Ãgama can be found in Minh Chau 1991: pp.87–95. A complete translation of this version and also of the other Chinese version from the Ekottara Ãgama, this being the first sûtra in the twelfth chapter (Yi Ru Dao) of the Ekottara Ãgama, can be found in Nhat Hanh 1990: pp.151–77. A comparison of the Satipaììhãna Saÿyutta with its corresponding Chinese version can be found in Choong 2000: pp.215–18, and in Hurvitz 1978: pp.211–29.
