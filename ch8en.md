## viii.1 CONTEMPLATION OF THE MIND

During the later part of the previous satipaììhãna, contemplation of feeling, awareness was concerned with the ethical distinction between worldly and unworldly feelings. The same distinction occurs at the start of the next satipaììhãna, which directs awareness to the ethical quality of the mind, namely to the presence or absence of lust (rãga), anger (dosa), and delusion (moha).[^1] The instructions are: ^8a

>He knows a lustful mind to be “lustful”, and a mind without lust to be “without lust”; he knows an angry mind to be “angry”, and a mind without anger to be “without anger”; he knows a deluded mind to be “deluded”, and a mind without delusion to be “without delusion”; he knows a contracted mind to be “contracted”, and a distracted mind to be “distracted”; he knows a great mind to be “great”, and a narrow mind to be “narrow”; he knows a surpassable mind to be “surpassable”, and an unsurpassable mind to be “unsurpassable”; he knows a concentrated mind to be “concentrated”, and an unconcentrated mind to be “unconcentrated”; he knows a liberated mind to be “liberated”, and an unliberated mind to be “unliberated”. [^2] ^8b

Contemplation of the mind makes use of altogether eight categories (cf. Fig. 8.1 below).[^3] In each case, the task of sati is to know a particular mental quality or its opposite, so that contemplation of the mind actually covers sixteen states of mind. The same set of sixteen states appears elsewhere in the discourses in relation to telepathic abilities.[^4] Thus from the perspective of the discourses this set forms a representative list of states of mind that is relevant both to personal introspection and to assessing another’s mind. ^8c

[^3]: In addition to these eight categories, the Chinese version of this contemplation in the Madhyama Ãgama lists the mind “with blemishes”, and “without blemishes”, while the Ekottara Ãgama has “craving” and “mastery of the mind” as additional categories (in Minh Chau 1991: p.93; and Nhat Than 1990: pp.162 and 174). Paìis II 234 includes the six types of consciousness (differentiated according to the six sense doors) in its list for contemplation of the mind.
