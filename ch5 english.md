## THE SATIPAÌÌHÃNA “REFRAIN” 

Having examined the “definition” of the Satipaììhãna Sutta at some length, I shall now look at a part of the discourse which could be called the “modus operandi” of satipaììhãna. [^1] This part, which I refer to as the “refrain”, occurs after each of the meditation exercises described in the discourse and presents four key aspects of satipaììhãna (cf. Fig. 5.1 below).  [^2] The task of this “refrain” is to direct attention to those aspects that are essential for the proper practice of each exercise. Thus an understanding of the implications of the “refrain” forms a necessary background to the meditation techniques described in the Satipaììhãna Sutta, which I will begin to examine in Chapter VI. 

>**In the case of the first satipaììhãna, the “refrain” reads: In this way, in regard to the body he abides contemplating the body internally, or he abides contemplating the body externally, or he abides contemplating the body both internally and externally. Or, he abides contemplating the nature of arising in the body, or he abides contemplating the nature of passing away in the body, or he abides contemplating the nature of both arising and passing away in the body. Or, mindfulness that “there is a body” is established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness. And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world.3
