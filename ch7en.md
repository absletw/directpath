vii.1 CONTEMPLATION OF FEELINGS 
The Pãli term for “feeling” is vedanã, derived from the verb vedeti, which means both “to feel” and “to know”. [^1] In its usage in the dis- courses, vedanã comprises both bodily and mental feelings. [^2] Vedanã does not include “emotion” in its range of meaning. [^3] Although emo- tions arise depending on the initial input provided by feeling, they are more complex mental phenomena than bare feeling itself and are therefore rather the domain of the next satipaììhãna, contempla- tion of states of mind. The satipaììhãna instructions for contemplation of feelings are:
When feeling a pleasant feeling, he knows “I feel a pleasant feeling”; when feeling an unpleasant feeling, he knows “I feel an unpleasant feeling”; when feeling a neutral feeling, he knows “I feel a neutral feeling.” When feeling a worldly pleasant feeling, he knows “I feel a worldly pleasant feeling”; when feeling an unworldly pleasant feel- ing, he knows “I feel an unworldly pleasant feeling”; when feeling a worldly unpleasant feeling, he knows “I feel a worldly unpleasant feeling”; when feeling an unworldly unpleasant feeling, he knows “I feel an unworldly unpleasant feeling”; when feeling a worldly neu- tral feeling, he knows “I feel a worldly neutral feeling”; when feelingan unworldly neutral feeling, he knows “I feel an unworldly neutral feeling”. [^4]
The first part of the above instructions distinguishes between three basic kinds of feelings: pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral. According to the discourses, developing understanding and detachment in re- gard to these three feelings has the potential to lead to freedom from dukkha. [^5] Since such understanding can be gained through the prac- tice of satipaììhãna, [^6] contemplation of feelings is a meditation prac- tice of considerable potential. This potential is based on the simple but ingenious method of directing awareness to the very first stages of the arising of likes and dislikes, by clearly noting whether the pres- ent moment’s experience is felt as “pleasant”, or “unpleasant”, or neither.
The systematic development of such immediate knowing will also strengthen one’s more intuitive modes of apperception, in the sense of the ability to get a feel for a situation or another person. This abil- ity offers a helpful additional source of information in everyday life, complementing the information gained through more rational modes of observation and consideration. In the satipaììhãna instructions, mindfulness of these three feel- ings is followed by directing awareness to an additional subdivision of feelings into “worldly” (sãmisa) and “unworldly” (nirãmisa).

[^6]: According to S V 189, for a penetrative understanding of the three types of feelings the four satipaììhãnas are to be developed. It is remarkable that according to this pas- sage all four satipaììhãnas are required for fully understanding feelings.

[^7]: The Chinese version of this contemplation in the Madhyama Ãgama additionally lists feelings connected with desire (and those which are not), and feelings related to food, while the Ekottara Ãgama version directs awareness to the fact that the presence of one type of feeling excludes the presence of the other two (in Minh Chau 1991: p.93; and Nhat Hanh 1990: pp.161 and 173). The latter suggestion has its Pãli parallel at D II 66. Additional categories can also be found at Paìis II 233, which includes feelings dif- ferentiated according to the six senses under contemplation of feelings. In fact, ac- cording to M I 398 the sixfold classification in the above satipaììhãna instructions can be further expanded not only by bringing in the six senses, but also by distinguishing occurrences in past, future, and present times, thereby totalling one-hundred-and- eight types of feeling altogether. An alternative threefold scheme for contemplation of feelings has been developed by Mogok Sayadaw (in Than Daing 1970: p.90) by dis- tinguishing between five sense door feelings as “external visitors”, mental feelings as “internal visitors”, and feelings related to in- and out-breathing as “host visitors”.
